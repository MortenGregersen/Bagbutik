 # JsonPointer
 An object that contains the JSON pointer that indicates the location of the error.

 In some cases, the JSON pointer may indicate an element that isnâ€™t in the request entity, but should be. For more information about JSON pointers, see the [RFC 6901](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) proposed standards document.
