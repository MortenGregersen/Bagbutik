      # Create or Update a Response to a Customer Review
      Create a response or replace an existing response you wrote to a customer review.

      Use this endpoint to create a response to a customer review and publish it in the App Store. If a response already exists, this endpoint updates the response by overwriting it.
      Responses donâ€™t appear in the App Store instantly. Allow some time for the App Store to publish the response.
